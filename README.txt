# Collaborative Social Science Data Analysis: Pair Assignment 3
In this repository you can find the third pair assignment for 'Introduction to Collaborative Data Science' at the Hertie School of Governance.

**Students:** Philipp St√§nder and Philip Unger. 

In the assignment we gather and combine the data sources we need for the final research project and present decriptive statistics and correlations that relate to our research question. 

**File description**
- GSS_data_downloader.R: Downloads the General Social Survey (GSS) and loads it as a data frame.
- deflator.R: Downloads the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) index from the St. Louis Federal Reserve and loads it as a data-frame in a format that can be merged with the GSS.
- CPS_Bertrand.R: Downloads the replication file from Bertrand (2013) and extracts data on income percentiles from the Current Population Survey. 
- GSS_prep_dynamic.R: Combines the data from the GSS, the PCE index and the CPS and performs data-transformations to creates the final dataset used for the descriptive stastistics and analysis presented in the markdown file. 
- data_combine.R: Sources the four above mentioned data files sequentially. 
- xx: Markdown file that creates the final 

The "data" folder contains the data-sets used for the analysis. Downloading and transforming the data-sets is time-consuming, thus  "data_combine.R" only downloads the files when they are not present in the data-folder. 

**Guide on how to reproduce the paper**
The markdown-file is dynamically reproducible and sources all relevant files, including downloading the different datasets. Note, however, it is computational demanding and can take 15-25 minutes. To ease computation, each of the data-generation files saves a dataset after their first run, and if they are present in the "data" folder, the markdown-file simply loads the final dataset rather than re-downloading and transforming them.
